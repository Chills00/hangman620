## Description
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

### Usage Instructions
- When prompted input your guess as a single letter character.
    - If the entry is invalid you will receive a message stating "Invalid letter. Please, enter a single alphabetical character."
    - If you have already guessed that letter you will receive a message stating "You already tried that letter"
    - Please enter a new guess.
- The program will check whether your guess is in the word and will respond with either:
    - "Good guess! *Your guess* is in the word." and the number of letters remaining will reduce by 1.
    - "Sorry, *Your guess* is not in the word. Try again." and your number of lives remaining will reduce by 1.
